# ENPM809K-Fundamentals-for-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Deep-Learning 
This repository contains my solutions and code submissions for assignments and projects completed as part of ENPM809K during Fall 2023. It's worth noting that this course is aligned with the curriculum of the Stanford CS231n class. Each assignment is organized in its own folder, with accompanying documentation and any necessary resources.

## üìö Course Overview
This course explores the transformative impact of data science in various domains, including consumer products, healthcare, and banking. It focuses on three key pillars:
1. Abundant and diverse data availability
2. Advancements in AI and ML algorithms for handling complex datasets
3. Breakthroughs in computer architectures

Emphasizing deep learning, the course covers foundational machine learning principles, advanced neural network techniques, and practical hands-on experience with leading frameworks like Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, enabling students to develop, assess, and troubleshoot neural networks for real-world applications.
