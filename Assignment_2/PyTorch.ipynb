So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore-input"],"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"2JlWE-78Z050","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698779029499,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Rishikesh Jadhav","userId":"00536845837947861709"}},"outputId":"b0500e9b-f187-472e-882e-935473a7b30b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Before flattening:  tensor([[[[ 0,  1],\n","          [ 2,  3],\n","          [ 4,  5]]],\n","\n","\n","        [[[ 6,  7],\n","          [ 8,  9],\n","          [10, 11]]]])\n","After flattening:  tensor([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5],\n","        [ 6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11]])\n"]}],"source":["def flatten(x):\n","    N = x.shape[0] # read in N, C, H, W\n","    return x.view(N, -1)  # \"flatten\" the C * H * W values into a single vector per image\n","\n","def test_flatten():\n","    x = torch.arange(12).view(2, 1, 3, 2)\n","    print('Before flattening: ', x)\n","    print('After flattening: ', flatten(x))\n","\n","test_flatten()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":["pdf-ignore"],"id":"WnGazB2wZ050"},"source":["### Barebones PyTorch: Two-Layer Network\n","\n","Here we define a function `two_layer_fc` which performs the forward pass of a two-layer fully-connected ReLU network on a batch of image data.

You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation

open-ended challenge, my goal was to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that achieves at least 70% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 validation set within 10 epochs. Here's a detailed explanation of what I did:\n","\n","## ConvNet Architecture\n","\n","I designed a custom ConvNet architecture using the nn.Sequential API. The architecture consisted of multiple key components:\n","\n","- Convolutional Layer 1: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel size, padding of 1, followed by ReLU and batch normalization.\n","- Convolutional Layer 2: 128 filters, 3x3 kernel size, padding of 1, followed by ReLU.\n","- Max-Pooling: Applied after the second convolutional layer.\n","- Convolutional Layer 3: 256 filters, 3x3 kernel size, padding of 1, followed by ReLU and batch normalization.\n","- Max-Pooling: Applied again after the third convolutional layer.\n","- Fully-Connected Layer 1: 512 units, followed by ReLU and dropout (50%).\n","- Fully-Connected Layer 2: Output layer with 10 units for 10 classes.\n","\n","## Hyperparameters\n","\n","- Learning Rate: 1e-3\n","- Optimizer: Adam (Adam optimizer with default parameters)\n","- Dropout: Used for regularization\n","- Batch Size: Default (not mentioned but can be specified as needed)\n","\n","## Training\n","\n","I trained the model for 10 epochs on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using the architecture and hyperparameters described above. The Adam optimizer was used for gradient descent, and the loss was minimized during training.\n","\n","## Results\n","\n","After 10 epochs of training, I checked the accuracy on the validation set my model achieved 79.10 % accuracy. Additional tuning and experimentation with hyperparameters, architecture, and regularization techniques may be required to achieve even more accuracy.\n","\n","## Additional Considerations\n","\n","- I considered alternative architecture,regularization techniques like Batchnorm and Dropout optimizer(Adam) and pooling techniques like Maxpooling and settled on the architecture described above.\n","- Data augmentation, model ensembles, and other advanced techniques could be used for further improvement but was not needed in this case.\n","\n","## Plot conclusion :\n","\n"," It's worth noting that, by the end of Epoch 3, the accuracy reaches around 76.30%. From that point, the accuracy improvement rate begins to slow down, and the model approaches an accuracy plateau. This plateau suggests that further training may have diminishing returns in terms of accuracy improvement.\n","\n"," The loss and accuracy trends suggest that the model has converged to a stable state, but further fine-tuning or experimentation could be explored if higher accuracy is needed.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8SUpGS8vZ05-"},"source":["## Test set -- run this only once\n","\n","Now that we've gotten a result we're happy with, we test our final model on the test set (which you should store in best_model).
